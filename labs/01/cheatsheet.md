## 1. Basic Formatting

### Headings
Headings are created with one or more `#` characters at the beginning of a line.  
The more `#` you use, the smaller the heading. Donâ€™t forget the space after the `#`.

**Example:**
# H1 - `# H1`
## H2 - `## H2`
### H3 - `### H3`  

### Paragraphs & Line Breaks
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.  
Line breaks are created by adding two spaces at the end of a line.

**Example:**

First paragraph.

Second paragraph with a line break.  

### Bold
Bold text is created using double asterisks `**`
Bold text can also be created by using double underscores `__`.

**Example:**
**This text is bold**. If only **certain** words need to be **bold**, just put the `**` around single words.   

### Italic
Italic is created with one asteriks `*`. 
Italic text can also be created by using the single underscore `_`.

**Example:**
_This text is in italic_. If only _certain_ words need to be _italic_, just put the `_` around single words.  

## Bold & Italic
Text can be in italic and bold using three asterisks `***` or three underscore `___`.

**Example:**
***This text is bold and italic***  

### Strikethrough
Strikethrough text is created with double tildes `~~`.

**Example:**
~~This text is with strikethrough~~. If only ~~certain~~ words need to be ~~strikethrough~~, just put the `~~` around single words.  

## Inline Code
Inline code is created by wrapping text in single backticks `` ` ``.  
This prevents Markdown from interpreting formatting symbols inside.

**Example:**
Use the command `git status` to check your repository.
