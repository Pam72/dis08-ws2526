## 1. Basic Formatting

### Headings
Headings are created with `#`. The more `#`, the smaller the heading. Note the space!

**Example:**
# H1 - '# H1'
## H2 - '## H2'
### H3 - '### H3'

### Bold
Bold is created with '**'
**This text is bold**. If only **certain** words need to be **bold**, just put the '**' around single words. Otherwise wrap the whole sentence with '**'.

### Italic
Italic is created with '_'. 

**Example:**
_This text is in italic_. If only _certain_ words need to be _italic_, just put the _ around single words. Otherwise wrap the whole sentence with '_'.

### Strikethrough
Strikethrough is created with '~~'.

**Example:**
~~This text is with strikethrough~~. If only ~~certain~~ words need to be ~~strikethrough~~, just put the '~~' around single words. Otherwise wrap the whole sentence with ~~.
